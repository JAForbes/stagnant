## Builds

You can view all the latest builds on unpkg [here](https://unpkg.com/browse/stagnant@latest/dist/).

### Browser

Stagnant is built to trace performance across the entire stack.  You can begin a trace client side, continue tracing within the server and then pick up the trace client side again.

This makes it possible to get far deeper insights into your Time to Interactive (TTI) and Time to Load (TTL).

The browser version of stagnant has no dependencies, it simply uses the native fetch module to call out to honeycomb for each event.  The node version uses the same code but relies on the `node-fetch` polyfill.

### Node.js

Depending on your project structure node.js will either import the native ESM module or the CJS build automatically.

- Native ESM Stagnant Module: `import stagnant from 'stagnant'`
- CJS Stagnant Bundle: `const stagnant = require('stagnant')`

- Native ESM Stagnant Honeycomb Module: `import stagnant from 'stagnant/honeycomb.js'`
- CJS Stagnant Honeycomb Bundle: `const stagnant = require('stagnant/honeycomb.cjs')`

> ðŸ¤“ If anyone knows how to make `require('stagnant/honeycomb')` automatically point to the `honeycomb.cjs` file, please let me know!

## Quick Start

- npm install `stagnant`

```js
import Stagnant from 'stagnant'

const traceOptions = {
    onevent({ id, name, data, parentId, startTime, endTime }){
        console.log(name, endTime - startTime)
    },

    // Advanced Options:
    //
    // onerror(){},
    // onsuccess(){},
    // onflush(){},
    // generateId(){},
    // traceId,
    // parentId
}

const stagnant = Stagnant(traceOptions)
async function main(){
    const I = stagnant()

    const package = 
        await I( () => fs.promises.readFile('package.json', 'utf8') )

    const files = 
        await I( 'ls', () => fs.promises.readdir('.') )

    for( let file of files ) {
        const filedata = I.sync( 'read file: ' + file,  () =>
            fs.readFileSync(file)
        )
    }
    
    await I.flush()
}
```

## Demonstration


```js

import Stagnant from 'stagnant'

async function main(trace){

    await trace(() => sql`
        select expensive_query()
    `)
    
    // trace is async by default to avoid Zalgo
    const file = await trace( () => fs.promises.readFile('package.json', 'utf8') )

    // for sync code, use trace.sync
    trace.sync( () => 2 + 2 )

    // add a meaningful name when the inferred name won't do 
    trace.sync('sequence loop', () => {

        for( let x of sequence() ) {
            someSyncCode(x)
        }
    })

    // create child traces, great for modelling the callstack
    await trace('somethingElse', p => 
        somethingElse(p)
    )


    await trace.flush()
}

async function somethingElse(trace){
    // this trace is a child trace ðŸ‘†
    // you can use this data to create useful graphs with e.g. honeycomb/open tracing

    await trace( () => sql`
        select another_expensive_query()
    `)

    // by default, names are inferred from the `toString()` of the callback
    // but you can specify a name explicitly as well
    let data = trace('custom-name', async () => {
        return anotherExpensiveCall()
    })

    // you can also attach metadata to the trace (and any child events)
    let data = trace({ name: 'custom-name', x:1, y:2 }, async () => {
        return anotherExpensiveCall()
    })

    // passing an object with no function, will attach that data
    // to all subsequent events
    trace(data)

    return true
}


const events = []
const options = {
    onevent(event){
        // capture all events
        events.push(event)
    },
    async onsuccess({ name, parentId, id, data, startTime, endTime }){
        console.log(startTime, name, 'duration:', endTime - startTime )
    },
    async onerror({ name, error, parentId, id, data, startTime, endTime }){
        console.error(
            startTime, name + ' (failed)', 'duration:', endTime - startTime
            ,'error:', error
        )
    }
}

const stagnant = Stagnant(options)
const trace = stagnant()

main(trace).finally( () => {
    // all events ready to inspect
    events

    // we've also been logging our events as they happened
    // we could be sending them to a tracing API if we prefer
})
```

## API

### Stagnant

`Stagnant(options: stagnant.Options ) -> StagnantInstance

Initialize a trace.

### Stagnant.call

`stagnant.call( trace?, ...args, () -> b ) -> b`

Safely invoke a trace callback even if the trace is null.  Fairly useful for writing wrappers around 3rd party libraries that may be invoked by code without a trace variable.

```js
async function something(event){

    // instead of:
    // await event.trace( 'normal invocation style', () => db.query('select 1+1') )
    await stagnant.call(event.trace, 'safer invocation style', () => db.query('select 1+1') )
}
```

### Stagnant.ensure

> Stability: ðŸ’€ Unstable

`trace = stagnant.ensure( trace? )`

Much like stagnant.call, but instead of immediately invoking the trace (if it exists), a mock trace is returned that will execute just fine but will not actually create any events or traces behind the scenes.

```js
async function something(event){
    event.trace = stagnant.ensure(event.trace)

    await event.trace( 'will work even if event.trace is null', () => db.query('select 1+1') )
}
```

### Trace

`Trace` is often aliased as `I` (for _instrument_).  Usually you invoke trace with a callback.  stagnant
will time how long it takes for a promise/generator/iterator/async function to settle.

```js
const stagnant = Stagnant(options)

// starts a new trace
let I = stagnant()

let output = await I( () => myAsyncFunction() )
```

You can also measure a synchronous function via `I.sync`

```js
let output = I.sync( () => mySynchronousFunction() )
```
You can attach data to the current event and any child events via `trace( data )`.

```js
// all child events will have the url and method property attached to event.data
I({ url, method })
```

You can also pass in data when setting up a callback to be traced:

```js
I({ url, method }, () => callEndpoint() )
```

By default `stagnant` will name the event using the `Function::toString()` method of your callback.  But you can explicitly name an event as well via two approaches.

1. Passing a string as the first argument
2. Including a `name` attribute on the event data object

```js
// string as first arg
I('call the endpoint', { url, method }, () => callEndpoint())

// name attribute on the data object
I({ name: 'call the endpoint', url, method }, () => callEndpoint())
```

You can create detailed call graphs by taking advantage of the child span constructor passed in to all callbacks:

```js

I( 'outer', I => // rebind I
    I('inner', I => // to create nested traces
        I('core', () => ... )
    )
)
```

Each event will have a `parentId` set to the `id` of the previous event.  This is great for explicitly modelling async call stacks.

When you are done measuring your code call `trace.flush` to signal to stagnant that the trace is over.


```js
await I.flush()
```

It's best to not use `I` after calling flush as the total duration of rootEvent will be less than the summed duration of any child events... which would be weird.

Keep in mind, `flush` doesn't wait for other events to finish that is your responsibility.  Generally call `flush` in a `finally` that wraps your entrypoint.

That's a high level philisophical distinction in stagnant with other libraries, there's next to no magic, just a nice pure dose of sugar.


### stagnant.Options

#### generateId

`() -> string`

Control how stagnant generates identifiers, by default `Math.random().toString(15).slice(2,8)` is used.

#### onevent

`async onevent( event: Event ) -> void`

Dispatched whenever a callback settles, whether it throws an exception or returns a value.

#### onsuccess

`async onsuccess( event: Event ) -> void`

Dispatched whenever a callback does not throw an exception.

#### onerror

`async onerror( event: ErrorEvent ) -> void`

Dispatched whenever a callback throws an exception.
#### onflush

`async onflush( event: RootEvent ) -> void`

Dispatched `.flush()` is called on the root trace.  Calling `flush` implies the end of the parent trace.  This is helpful for measuring overall run time of a trace.

## Event

```typescript
{
    // id of the parent event
    parentId: string

    // reference to the parent event
    , parent: Trace

    // id of the current trace
    , traceId

    // id of the current event 
    , id: string

    // event metadata, just a state bag with no schema
    , data: any

    // time is represented as a millisecond unix timestamp
    , startTime: number
    , endTime: number
}
```

## ErrorEvent

```typescript
Event & { error: Error }
```

Just like an event, but with an error attached.  This will be dispatched to your callback whenever a callback throws an exception.

## Advanced

### Logging

By default stagnant calls `config.console` for all logging.  These logs functions are just empty functions.  You can enable logging by specifying `console: console` when initializing stagnant.

When initializing honeycomb configuring stagnant options requires an outer key `config` so `{ config: { console } }`

## FAQ

### How do I disable stagnant when testing offline?

There are several ways, but the easiest is to override `config.onevent`.

You can simply replace config.onevent with a no-op function, but the events themselves are useful for testing, so you may instead want to replace `onevent` with a method that pushes traces into a list that you can examine from your tests.

```js
let events = []
let stagnant = Stagnant({
    onevent(event){
        events.push(event)
    },
    onflush(){
        events.length = []
    }
})

test('Sign up email was sent', async t => {
    await callApi()

    let event = events.find( x => x.name == 'sendEmail' )
    t.ok(event)

    t.ok(event && event.response.status, 200)
})
```

If you do not want the events in offline mode, you can also easily mock the stagnant API by passing `null` to `stagnant.ensure`.  This just returns a function that mimics a stagnant trace function, but doesn't actually do anything except execute the functions you pass in.

Both approaches allow you to keep your traces in your live production code even if you want to temporarily disable them in certain contexts.

```js

let I = stagnant.ensure(null)

I( 'trace', () => {
    // hello is logged, but no traces recorded
    console.log('hello')
})

// this metadata is ignored and discarded immediately
I({ a:1, b: 2 })
```

### What is a trace vs a parent vs an event?

A trace is simply a group of events.  All events sharing the same trace_id are considered part of that trace.  Theoretically you could infer a relationship between events by following the tree of parent/child events.  But if you set only the parentId and not the traceId, tools like honeycomb will get confused.

### How do I instrument 3rd party libraries if everything is explicit?

Short answer, you don't.  

Long answer, instead of directly calling the 3rd party library, call your own function that calls the library and time that.

You can use `stagnant.call( trace, () => ...)` or `stagnant.ensure(trace)` instead of `trace( () => ... )` to safe guard against not having a trace variable.

If the trace is undefined, `stagnant` will just invoke the callback without creating a trace.  That way you can write code that will behave just fine even if there is no trace variable passed down.  This also means you can disable tracing in your codebase without having to restructure your code beyond not passing down a trace at the entry point.

```js
const Stagnant = require('stagnant')

function query(query, values, I=null){
    I = Stagnant.ensure(I)
    const results = await I(() => db.query(query,values))
    return results
}

// this will not perform a trace
await query('select * from users where user_id = ? ', [1], null)

// this will perform a span within the active trace
await query('select * from users where user_id = ? ', [1], I)
```

### Why use callbacks for everything

It helps capture absolutely everything safely.  Everything that is measured can be wrapped in a try catch, and the execution itself can be deferred, or even skipped if required when you are debugging things.

It is a sensible default.

### But won't using anonymous functions introduce signifcantly delays?

For application profiling, no, the delay will be neglible.  For something low level like a virtual dom diffing algorithm, maybe.

### How do I continue a trace across multiple servers or contexts?

Send the `parentId` and `traceId`to your API via a header, then when initializing stagnant serverside call `let I = I.resume({ id: parentId, traceId })`. 

See the [honeycomb implementation](./honeycomb.js) for ideas.

### How do I get the activeTrace?

In other tracing libraries, instrumentation is automatic and is quite complicated.  For example in honeycomb's Node.js beeline the async_hooks module is used to figure out whether an async function invocation belongs to another async call stack that is related to a given trace.

Finding out the active trace in these libraries is a complex system that isn't foolproof.  It is possible to lose the active trace by nesting an async function, or using an iife, or any other range of behaviours async_hooks trips up on.


In stagnant, all instrumentation is manual.  Because it is manual, you always have a reference to every trace, because you are the one that invoked the tracing function `I`.

There is no ambiguity or complex system.  When you start a new span, you can know that any code that runs inside that block belongs to the span/trace.

```js
await I( 'example', async I => {
    let traceId = I.traceId()
    let id = I.id()
})
```

If you want some api request, db query or other async task to belong to a trace, you need to pass that `I` reference around and wrap the given task in that reference.

```js

async function request(I, ...){
    return I( () => fetch(...) )
}

await I( 'example', async I => {
    let traceId = I.traceId()
    let id = I.id()

    const users = await request(I, 'https://example.com/api/users')
})
```

If you just want requests to belong to the overall trace but not necessarily nested under the span that invoked the request, you can just use a different `I` reference. 

```js
await I( async I => {

    async function request(...){
        // accesses I via a closure
        return I( () => fetch(...) )
    }
    
    await I( 'example', async I => {
        let traceId = I.traceId()
        let id = I.id()
    
        // does not use the current I reference, uses the parent one
        const users = await request('https://example.com/api/users')
    })
})
```

## Honeycomb integration

*A visualization of a call graph as measured by `stagnant` using the honeycomb integration.*

Stagnant can be used offline and with any 3rd party instrumentation toolkit you prefer to use.  I originally wrote this tool as I was continually having issues with the official node.js honeycomb beeline library.  I was often getting issues with missing traces, and missing parent spans and I couldn't figure it out.  After spending a lot of time on it, I figured it was easier to just write an adpater that is 100% explicit and doesn't rely on Node's [async_hooks](https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html) module.

So here we are.  I share with you the same integration just in case it is useful for to you.  But stagnant can be used as a standalone library just as easily.

There is a simple [honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io) integration in [`stagnant/honeycomb.js`](./honeycomb.js).  Check out the [usage script](./honeycomb-usage.js) to set it up in your own project.
